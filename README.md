# decal-bath
Arduino based Heated Decal Bath control software

## Background
Application of water-slide decals on scalemodels goes a little bit easier if the water is warm.

This project is based on a FDM 3D printed frame and some electronics that controls PCB heatbed of approx 8 Ohm. An external 12VDC power-plug is needed as well. 
The UI consist of a 1.3" OLED display with 128x64 pixels, using the SSD1306 controller and three buttons.

## Design and other resources
This will soon be updated with more information.
